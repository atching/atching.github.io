I am currently a PhD Student in the Ubiqitous Computing at the Unversity of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science. My research interests are at the intersection of sensing, wearable technology, and machine learning with a focus on health and biosignals. I build novel low power systems to collect sensor data and use signal processing and machine learning to extract usable information. Previously, I spent 10 years working in groups primarily doing work in next generation AR/VR research and development. You can find more details in the Research tab.

Professional Experience
------
Prior to coming back to the UW full time in Fall 2023, I was a full time hardware/research engineer in industry for 10 years having worked at Valve, Microsoft Research, Magic Leap, Microsoft Mixed Reality, and most recently as a Senior Electrical Engineer at Meta Reality Labs Research. I have previously interned in technical roles at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), Intellectual Ventures Lab, Cisco Systems, and Ball Aerospace. During my undergrad, I participated in the Human Powered Submarine Team and also participated in a zero gravity flight with NASA as part of the Microgravity University.

Education
------
I have a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Washington with my research project on finger based pre-hypertension detection using photoplethsmography. I have a B.S in Mechanical Engineering, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a focus on Embedded Systems. I am currently 1 year post-quals in my PhD, and working towards my generals exam with an expected graduation date in late 2025/early 2026.

Teaching
------
I have been a teaching assistant for the following University of Washington courses:
* CSE475 - Embedded Systems Capstone (AUT22, AUT23, AUT24)
* CSE461 - Computer Networking (WIN24)
* CSE474 - Introduction to Embedded Systems (SPR24)
* EE443  - Signal Processing Capstone (WIN14)

I have also given the following talks:
* SUM23 - Intro to Hardware - UW UbicompLab Interns
* WIN24 - Intro to PCB Design with Altium Tutorial - UW Engineering
* SUM24 - Intro to Hardware - UW Ubicomplab Interns

Personal
------
Outside of the lab I enjoy travelling and have made ample use of my passport having explored over 25 countries on 5 continents with my camera. Check out some of my photos in the Photography tab.
