Hi! I am currently a PhD Student at the Unversity of Washington Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science.

Education
------
Prior to coming back to the UW full time in Fall 2023, I was a full time hardware/research engineer in industry for 10 years having previously worked at Meta Reality Labs, Microsoft, Magic Leap, Microsoft Research, and Valve. I have previously interned during my undergraduate years in technical roles at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), Intellectual Ventures, Cisco Systems, Ball Aerospace, and SNUPI. During my undergrad, I participated in the Human Powered Submarine Team and also flew a Zero Gravity mission with NASA as part of the Microgravity University.

Research
------
My current research interests are at the intersection of personal sensing and clinical research. I have also spent 10 years working in industrial research and advanced technology groups primarily doing work in next generation AR/VR research.

Personal
------
Outside of the lab I enjoy travelling and have made ample use of my passport having explored over two dozen countries on 5 continents with my camera.
